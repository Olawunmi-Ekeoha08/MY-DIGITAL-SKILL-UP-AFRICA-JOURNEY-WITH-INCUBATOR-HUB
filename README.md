# MY-DIGITAL-SKILL-UP-AFRICA-JOURNEY-WITH-INCUBATOR-HUB
### I started my DSA journey on March 31st.
### I registered for Data Analysis, I already had an idea of Data Analysis, I only wanted more insight to improve my knowledge of it.
 
  ### Honestly, I must say I haven't regretted that decision because the classes have broadened my knowledge in D.A., and I can't wait to explore and practice to be better.
  
## Here are the classes we had :
- ### Microsoft Excel
- ### SQL
- ### Power Bi.
One of the most challenging modules of the classes was SQL, which stressed me, but I tackled it with everything in me. I can't  say I have gotten the hang of it yet, but I am getting there.

### On Microsoft Excel 
Microsoft Excel is straightforward and at the same time tricky if not careful. One of the challenges I had in Excel was the IF function.
